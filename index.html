    <h1>Privacy Policy — Ordering Agent</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 16, 2025</p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Ordering Agent (“we”, “us”) is an app provided by Neatly Brands. This policy explains how we handle personal information when you use our app and any Meta integrations (Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp).</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only what we need to run the app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account/contact info you provide (e.g., name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Content you submit in the app (e.g., messages, orders, requests)</li>
      <li>Meta platform data if you connect via Meta (e.g., identifiers, business/page info, messaging metadata/content as needed for the integration)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the app’s features</li>
      <li>Support messaging/integration functionality you enable</li>
      <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and debug issues</li>
      <li>Provide customer support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

    <h2>How we share information</h2>
    <p>We may share information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With Meta as required to provide the integration you enabled</li>
      <li>With service providers (e.g., hosting, logs/analytics) who process data on our behalf under confidentiality obligations</li>
      <li>If required by law or to protect safety, rights, and security</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>We keep information only as long as needed to operate the app, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes. We may delete or anonymize data when it is no longer needed.</p>

    <h2>Data security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect information. No system is 100% secure, but we work to prevent unauthorized access and misuse.</p>

    <h2>Your choices and deletion requests</h2>
    <p>You can request access or deletion of your data by emailing: <a href="mailto:neatlybrands@gmail.com">neatlybrands@gmail.com</a>. If you use Meta login or messaging features, you can also manage some permissions through your Meta account settings.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your location). We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
